        <h1>Welcome to Ashley's Apps</h1>
        <p> This is my final project. I made my game based off a few of the states. It's basically a trivia game based off some common knowledge on the selected states that I chose.
        In order to play you just need to press the start button. For every scene you just need to click on each answer as it will tell you 
        if it is incorrect or it will progress you to the next screen if you are correct. Good luck!
